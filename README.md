## Project Setup

To get started with this project, please follow the steps below:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/DougInVentura/AI_Course_Project_3_Team_1]
   ```
2. **Install Required Libraries:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**
   Navigate to the notebook directory and start the Jupyter Notebook to explore data preparation steps:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook data_preparation.ipynb
   ```
4. **Execute the Model Script:**
   Run the script to train and evaluate the model:
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```

## Data Collection and Cleaning

Describe the sources of your data and the methodology used to clean and preprocess it. This section could include:
- Data sources
- Key steps in data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exporting the cleaned data for modeling

## Model Implementation and Optimization

This section explains the model(s) used, including any additional libraries or technologies that were incorporated beyond the class syllabus. It should cover:
- Description of the initial model setup and rationale
- Iterative improvements and optimizations made
- Final model configuration and performance metrics

## Results

Summarize the model's performance and the conclusions drawn from applying the model to your data. Include key metrics that highlight the model's effectiveness.

## Future Work

Discuss potential improvements or next steps for the project if more time and resources were available. This could include:
- Exploring additional data sources
- Trying different model architectures or algorithms
- Deploying the model as a web or mobile application
